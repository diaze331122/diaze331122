HUG - A Human User Guide!

Summary:

I am a full stack developer currently employed at Harled. I have 2+ years of experience as a developer in the publishing industry. My interests lie with emerging tech health and crypto. Open Science has always been a passion of mine and I strongly advocate for society to be empowered by having access to peer reviewed data. I usually prefer to work independently but recently I have taken a liking to peer programming. I also prefer to work with easy going people that can stay focused on the task. Working with others is always a learning experience!

My ideal physical working environment is one where it is well lit with some low background noise and strong scent (either cinnamon or coffee). You could say that I am motivated after "big wins" (alternatively, a cup of coffee will do). When peer programming, I prefer it when it is kept to "short bursts". That is, we'll get together for a little bit, discuss the objective of the work that needs to be done, the scope, the impact and if time permits, some get-to-know-you. Sessions can be for an hour max. If we have not completed the objective, we can begin a new session where we left off. Rinse and repeat. I think this will maximize productivity as teammates are allowed the opportunity to take a breath, relax and reflect. I also prefer to take notes during meetings/session so if you notice me scribbling away or if I ask you to repeat yourself, I am only taking notes to later reflect on. 

I am fairly introverted so my default approach to problem solving is to work independently. For the work itself, if it is something I have never dealt with (ie. new programming language/framework) I will do some research first. Otherwise, I will just jump into it.

In terms, of feedback, I like it in the format of "the issue" => "how I am tackling" => "why it is a reasonable/poor approach" => "how to improve". Even in the seemingly best systems, there is always room for improvement. 

I have gotten more comfortable with asking questions and if I am bugging you too much, just let me know!

My Final Thoughts:

Although I do not have a lot of professional experience, I will do my best to aid others in their tasks. Currently, I am learning and receiving mentoring on Ruby and how to elevate as developer (not just from a technical perspective). I did spend some time with data analysis, crons and debugging so I'm pretty good at any of those (hit me up if you need help!).
