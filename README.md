HUG - A Human User Guide!

Summary:

I am a full stack developer currently employed at Harled. I have 2+ years of experience as a developer in the publishing industry. My interests lie with emerging tech health and crypto. Open Science has always been a passion of mine and I strongly advocate for society to be empowered by having access to peer reviewed data. I usually prefer to work independently but recently I have taken a liking to peer programming.

PS: The best way to understand and learn about someone is to talk to them! Don't take this HUG seriously!

Questions to be addressed:

- Q: What energizes you?
- A: A cup of Coffee and starting a new project (definitely the dopamine!)
  
- Q: What depletes your energy?
- A: Doing things for the sake of doing it without a good reason/goal.
  
- Q: Introvert or extrovert?
- A: Introvert
  
- Q: What is your approach to problem solving? Research or dive in?
- A: I prefer to do a bit of both. If I am tackling an issue that I have never dealth with (ie. uses a different programming language), I usually do as much research as I can. Otherwise, I'll just jump right into it. 
  
- Q: When are you most productive?
- A: I am most productive when the requirements are clear. Sure, there are times when ambiguity is inevitable but that is something you will want to avoid and not actively strive for.

- Q: How do you like to receive feedback?
- A: I like it in the format of "the issue" => "how I am tackling" => "why it is a reasonable/poor approach" => "how to improve". Even in the seemingly best systems, there is always room for improvement.
  
- Q: What are your pet peeves?
- A: My pet peeves are rather personal and is not suited to disclose in a HUG.
  
- Q: Are you open to mentoring others? On what topics?
- A: I am not open to mentoring as I am currently not at that stage in my life. However, I can help others when asked.
  
- Q: Are you looking to be mentored? On what topics?
- A: I would like to receive mentoring in Ruby, how to become a better teamplayer and how to elevate as a developer.

- Q: Technologies you like / dislike?
- A: I like Ruby as a developer due to its DX approach. I dislike PHP.
